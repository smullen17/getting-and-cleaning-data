Description:
Experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 561 metrics were gathered for each activity.

Obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data sets. The observed metrics are stored as numeric values

70% of the observations went into the training set (x_train, y_train)  which was 7,352 observations
30% went into the test set (x_test, y_test) which was 2,947 observations

There were  six activity types and the mapping for those are found in Activities_Labels.txt
There were 561 differnet metrics and the names are stored in features.txt file
